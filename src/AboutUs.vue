    <p> We are one of LCHS's many clubs. We help people with tech issues and try to improve the school using technology. </p>
    <br>
    <p> For example, we're working on a streamlined method for people to view all homework in one place.</p>
    <p> If you want to check us out, we meet in the Help Lab (mostly) every monday! </p>
